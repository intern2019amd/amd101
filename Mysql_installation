Installing Mysql on your server.

Prerequisites:
-Make sure you are logged into your server with a user account with sudo privileges or with the root user.

1)Enable the MySQL 8.0 repository with the following command:

$ sudo yum localinstall https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm

$sudo yum install mysql-community-server

//During the installation yum may prompt you to import the MySQL GPG key. Type y and hit Enter.


2)Starting Mysql :

$ sudo systemctl enable mysqld
$ sudo systemctl start mysqld

-Check the status:

$ sudo systemctl status mysqld

3)When the MySQL server is started for the first time, a temporary password is generated for the MySQL root user. You can find the password by running the following command:

$ sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

Then: 

$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
-After entering the temporary password you will be asked to set a new password for user root.

4)To log in to the MySQL server as the root user type:
 $ mysql -u root -p
