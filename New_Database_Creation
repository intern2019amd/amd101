Create a Database.


-Once you are connected to the MySQL shell, you can create a new database by typing the following command:

mysql>CREATE DATABASE new_database;


-Now that we created a database we can create a table to store some data.

Before running the SQL statements for creating a table we need to connect to the database:

mysql>use new_database;

-In this example we will create a simple table named contacts with three fields, id, name and email:

CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(30),
  email VARCHAR(30)
);


-To view the database youâ€™ve created, from within the MySQL shell execute the following command:

mysql>SHOW DATABASES;
